## Registry System

### 12/04/2025

System 1: Registry .js file for each type of object that has a json registry and a constructor function for each item.

System 2: Registry .js file for each type of object that has just a constructor function for each item, and all information punched in there.

After experimenting both systems, I think system 2 is better for our project. Prof taught me that system 1 is convention, and is better for maneuverability, but I think that since our project scale is well defined, we can confidently use system 2 without facing any drawbacks.
