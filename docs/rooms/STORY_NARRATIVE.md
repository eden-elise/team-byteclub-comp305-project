I wake to the sound of water. Not the gentle kind that flows in rivers and fountains, but a slow, indifferent trickle that nags at the back of your head. Each drop hits stone with the same hollow cadence. My back is frigid against a hard slick wall and my head steadily throbs with a painstaking ache. My face is pressed against something damp that smells of rust and old straw.

I slowly open my eyes.

I am in a small, damp enclosed room. When I go to lift my hand to my temple, chains rattle against the ground. There are chains around my wrists. There is one large door across the room. Through a small barred hole in the door a lantern swings beyond, its light slowly swaying like a pendulum. Chains hang from hooks in the wall across from me, catching that lantern light in dull flashes. Symbols are carved on the walls around and outside the cell, loops, spirals, jagged stars, filled with dried dark residue that might once have been ink.

Near my knee lies a small glass vial, half buried in straw. The glass is cloudy, the liquid inside a deep rust red, as if someone tried to bottle old blood and smoke together. A torn scrap of parchment clings to its side, the ink mostly smeared away except for a sigil that matches the one on the wall. Instinct supplies a label my conscious mind does not have to earn: **Cracked Red Tonic**, something that will knit torn flesh for a short time. I slide it into a pocket at my belt I do not remember owning, but which my fingers find automatically.

My name. I do not know my name. The realization arrives very slowly and calmly. I reach inside myself for my name, who I am, and draw nothing. I feel only the smooth surface of a wiped slate. There is fear and worry, certainly, rising in my throat, but it is strangely impersonal, like watching a stranger drown.

I move to sit up straighter, and that is when I see my wrist.

A sigil has been burned into my skin, still raw and red, an ouroboros made of teeth. Tiny incisors and canines, each one interlocking with the next in an endless ring. The flesh around it is puckered and glossy, as though it has healed many times from the same wound. My stomach turns. The mark feels wrong, dark in its essence.

The cell door stands half open, hanging crooked on its hinges. Why would it be open? Someone let me out or forgot to lock me in. The stone corridor beyond slopes away into darkness. A bell tolls somewhere above, five slow chimes that vibrate through the walls and into my teeth.

I put a hand against the wall and push myself up. My legs shake with fatigue, but they remember how to stand even if my mind does not remember anything else. As I step through the doorway, the teeth on my wrist seem to pulse once with a faint heat.

---

### **I. The Cells**

The corridor is a spine of stone lined with iron mouthed cages. Some doors hang open. Some remain shut. All of them are marked with variations on the sigils carved into my own flesh. Circles intersecting circles, triangles nested like teeth, lines that loop back on themselves in ways that make my eyes ache. The air tastes of metal and the flat, sour residue of fear.

My footsteps sound too loud. With every step a feeling grows that is not quite a memory, more like the ghost of one, the sense of having done this before. It is as if my body already knows where to go, like I am familiar with the layout, yet visually it all looks foreign. Turn here, my mind tugs; do not look too closely into that cell.

I look anyway.

The first door I pass has been forced inward. The bed inside is a slab of stone with a dark indentation in the center, as if someone has paced in circles and worn the rock away. On the floor near the indentation lies a small stoppered bottle the color of swamp water. When I pick it up, the liquid inside clings to the glass in slow, syrupy sheets. The label has long since rotted, but a faint sigil on the wax matches one I half remember from diagrams of recovery. A slow working draught, meant to restore strength over time rather than in a single jolt. I pocket it without thinking.

Another cell holds nothing but chains so thick they must have been meant for something that could bend steel. A ring of keys lies beside them, their teeth broken and twisted through with sigils so that normal locks would never accept them. One key, though, bears a small fragment of the tooth ouroboros etched near its bow. My wrist burns in response. I take that one. The metal is cold and heavy, a **Sigiled Cell Key** I know will open more than simple doors.

The third cell contains a shape.

At first I take it for a heap of discarded rags. Then the rags move, unfolding into the outline of a human form. A mask glints faintly in the dark: iron, cracked down the center, covering everything but the eyes.

My heart skips a beat and I freeze.

There is a moment in which nothing happens. No sound but the drip, and my raging pulse, and the slow creak of the lantern back in my own cell swinging on its hook. Then the thing stands.

Chains trail from its arms and shoulders, dragging along the floor with a sound like knives along glass. It is tall, impossibly thin, the clothes hanging from it stiff with dried something. It tilts its head to one side, the way a curious dog might.

It should not know me, but it does. I see it in the small, attentive lift of its posture.

“Subject awake,” it rasps through the cracked mask. The voice is dry and papery, full of dust. “Iteration… lost. No matter. Corridor protocol engaged.”

My throat tightens.

There is a part of me that wants to run, to slip past it and sprint blindly down the hall. Another part, the one that feels oddly clinical, notes with appraisal the way it moves, jerky but powerful, weight distributed through the chains like a pendulum ready to swing.

I do not know which part of me wins. I only know that when it lunges, I am already reaching for something at my belt that is not there, already stepping aside in a pattern that feels deeply familiar.

The warden, for I cannot think of it as anything else, swings its chains. I duck out of the way. Before I can think it lashes out again and I twist, heel pivoting on the stone, the movement practiced enough that my body performs it without my consent. There is a shard of broken iron near my foot. I scoop it up and drive it into the soft gap beneath the mask.

Chains clatter. The thing shudders once, then collapses with a sound like an empty rack of armor falling to the floor.

As it falls, something slips free from the folds of its robe and skids across the stone to my feet: a small crystal ampoule filled with faintly glowing liquid, a pale silver that refuses to stay still. It swirls in slow spirals, almost as if trying to form glyphs and then giving up. A **Mystery Phial**, some experimental concoction meant for subjects rather than guards. The label is gone. The effect is unknown. I pocket it anyway. There is a comfort in knowing that I carry at least one wild card.

I am left panting in the quiet, hands shaking, heart pounding too fast. It is not the violence that has shocked me, but the familiarity of my own reactions. I fought like someone who has done this exact dance before.

More than once.

The sick certainty blooms in my chest: this is not the first time I have walked this corridor.

Something glows at the edge of my vision.

Beyond the fallen warden, a side door stands ajar. Warm light spills from within, steady and pulsing, not the flicker of a torch. Compelled, I step over the heap of chains and push the door open.

The room inside is small and circular, the floor dominated by a chalk circle ringed in candles burned down to stubs. At its center, hovering a few inches above bare stone, is a shard of glass the size of my palm. Light and shadow swirl inside it like trapped smoke.

The mark on my wrist burns.

As I step closer, the shard flares brighter, threads of luminescence reaching out as if in recognition. I know, without knowing how, that touching it will hurt, and that I have done so before. Beside the circle sits a small metal rack of phials, most of them shattered, their contents long evaporated and dried into dark, crusted stains. One remains whole, filled with faintly luminous blue liquid. The sigil on its side marks it as a **Minor Focus Draught**, something that sharpens thought and helps hold onto impressions a little longer. I tuck it carefully into my belt, a future edge against whatever is trying to scrape my mind smooth.

I reach out for the shard anyway.

The shard sears my fingers. Heat races up my arm and drives nails into my skull. For a heartbeat I am nowhere and everywhere at once, blinded by white.

Then there is a laboratory.

Red candles gutter in iron brackets along the walls, casting long shadows over tables laden with glass and bone and copper wire. There is a circle on the floor here too, more elaborate than the one in the cell, its lines precise, its center dark with old stains.

A man stands beside it.

He wears a high collared coat the color of dried blood, the fabric too fine for this grim room. His hair is black and tied back, his skin remarkably pale even in this light, the bones of his face sharp enough to cut. His eyes, dark, amused, endlessly patient, fix on me with the intimate regard of a craftsman considering a favored tool.

“You have a talent for this,” he says.

In the vision my hands are steady, precise. I am kneeling beside the circle, chalk and knife in my grip. An arm lies across my lap, attached to someone lying just out of sight, its skin bare and waiting. I draw the sigil carefully onto that skin, the small teeth of the ouroboros taking shape beneath my blade. Rows of labeled phials line the nearby bench: **Coagulating Elixirs**, **Nerve Dampeners**, **Rebinding Serums**. I know each formula. Worse, I remember arguing for their efficiency.

“With enough iterations,” the man continues, “we can strip a mind clean.”

He says it the way a mathematician might speak of limits, or a physician of disease. I feel pride rise in my chest, washing away the subject’s muffled whimpers.

I look up at him.

“Thank you, Lord Dravik,” I say with my own voice, in this memory that is not a memory. “I live to refine the method.”

The white glare returns, tearing everything away.

I am back in the cell room, kneeling on cold stone, hand still burning where the shard melted into my skin. My breath comes in sharp, fast pulls. The taste of iron is in my mouth, but I do not know if it is from the memory or from biting my own tongue.

Lord Dravik.

The name settles into me like a key into a well worn lock. My hands tremble, but not from fear. Not entirely. There is a different feeling tangled in there now, a thin, horrified recognition.

I designed the sigil on my wrist.

I helped build whatever this place is.

I am not a captive here. I am an architect who has lost the blueprint.

---

### **II. The Servants’ Floor**

The staircase up from the cells is narrow, the stones worn smooth with use. As I climb, torches flicker to life in iron brackets, responding either to my presence or to some timing mechanism I must have helped construct and subsequently forgotten.

Halfway up, I find a small niche cut into the wall. A dusty wooden box rests inside, marked with a servant’s shorthand sigil. Inside are two small items: a tightly wrapped packet of dried leaves with a bitter, metallic smell, and a tiny clay bottle painted with a crescent moon. Memories of dosing exhausted servants swim at the edge of my mind. The leaves steep into a **Stamina Brew**, the clay bottle holds a **Nightshade Tincture**, poisonous in high doses, stunning in small ones. I take them both.

The air changes halfway up. It is less damp, more smoke. When I step out onto the next floor, I recognize the smell instantly, cooked onions, fat, stale bread.

The Servants’ Floor.

I do not know how I know its name, but I do.

The corridor here is broader, its walls hung with threadbare tapestries showing hunting scenes and battlefields. Doors line either side, some leading to narrow bunkrooms stacked with cots, others to storerooms of barrels and sacks. Voices drift faintly from somewhere ahead, the clatter of dishes, a snatch of song.

I move quietly, but not quietly enough.

As I pass an open doorway, a woman turns from a long table piled with vegetables. She is older, her apron stained, her hair wrapped in a scarf. For a moment her eyes go wide at the sight of me, blood on my sleeves, mask dust still clinging to my clothes.

Then her face crumples into something like weary resignation.

“Oh, it is you again,” she says.

Something cold slides down my spine. “Again?”

She lifts her chin toward the ceiling, toward the towers above. “His Lordship rang the bell. Means you are loose.” She wipes her hands on her apron. “Did the warden hold up better this time?”

“I…” My mouth is dry. “I do not remember.”

Her gaze softens, but the pity in it is strictly professional, the way one might look at a broken tool that still has its uses. “That is how you designed it, love. You and him. Wipe it all away each time so you cannot get clever between loops.”

Each time.

“Why are you telling me this?” I ask faintly.

She shrugs. “You always get this far. Sometimes you ask. Sometimes you do not.” A pause. “Sometimes you beg.”

My throat closes.

She reaches under the table and pulls out a small basket. Inside are corked bottles, each filled with murky green liquid that smells aggressively of garlic and herbs. “You always trade for these too,” she says. “You brewed them yourself once. Said a dose of this would keep folk on their feet longer, even when the fear took them.”

I take one bottle. The glass is warm from her hands. A **Kitchen Tonic**, crude but effective, a little burst of health bound in vegetables, fat, and the smallest touch of alchemy. I tuck it away with a mute nod.

I back away from the doorway and into the corridor, her eyes following me. Her gaze has the distance of someone watching a play for the hundredth time. She knows the script. The novelty lies only in my improvisations.

I walk the rest of the floor in a daze.

Servants move around me with the efficient rhythm of people whose routines have become ritual. Some make a point of ignoring me. Others nod respectfully, calling me “apprentice” or “sir” without warmth. A few cross themselves with sigils that clearly predate Dravik’s invention, old gestures clashing with new marks.

In one pantry I pass, I cannot help but notice shelves lined with crude bottled mixtures, more of my old work, labeled in my hand. **Rapid Coagulants**, **Fear Soothers**, **Wound Stitchers**. Most are empty. A lone small bottle, filled with faintly golden liquid, sits at the back. A **Lesser Regeneration Draught**, if the sigil is to be believed. I slide it into my belt.

Memory flickers at the edges of my vision again, sketches on parchment, charts of bell times and corridor patrol routes. When I try to grasp them they dissolve.

In the trophy hall, beneath the heads of beasts and men mounted on the walls, I find another shard.

This one is embedded in the eye socket of a wolf skull, its surface rippling like water. When I touch it, the world lurches.

I am back in the laboratory, this time standing rather than kneeling. The chalk circles are sharper, the candles replaced with glass tubes channeling a crimson glow. Dravik stands beside me, hands folded behind his back, watching as a servant leads in a young man with bandaged wrists.

“You did well refining the sigil,” Dravik murmurs as the subject is strapped into the center circle. “But we still need a better test case.”

I turn to him in the memory. My face feels strangely intact from the inside, all expressions familiar and yet repulsive now that I see them from afar. Vials of color line the bench behind me, blues for memory softeners, greens for emotional blunting, clear ones for simple physical healing. We are surrounded by cures, and not one of them is meant to free anyone.

“We could use more volunteers,” I suggest. “Those willing to forget. Criminals. Penitents. They would line up for relief.”

He studies me for a long moment, then smiles in a way that exposes nothing of his teeth and everything of his intention. “Why look outward,” he says softly, “when the most relevant mind is already at hand?”

My pulse stutters.

“You designed the ritual,” he continues. “You understand your own traumas, your own fragmentations. You wish to excise them, do you not. What better demonstration of faith, in the method and in me, than to be the first true subject?”

The remembered me looks down at my wrist. There is no sigil there yet, only bare, unmarked skin.

“I…” I begin.

The vision shifts, becoming a series of overlapping images, my hand signing a contract written in red; my arm extended over the circle; Dravik’s breath cool against the inside of my elbow as he guides the knife in my hand to carve the first line of the ouroboros. Phials clink as he moves them aside, making room for the new bottle labeled **Apprentice Baseline Sample**, which he will never allow me to drink.

“You came willingly,” he whispers in my ear. “You came to be perfected.”

The shard’s heat collapses inward. I stagger back into the trophy hall, gulping air.

I remember very little in strict detail, but the emotional truth of the revelation is clear and heavy as lead: I was not dragged into this castle. I walked in, eager, seeking to sever myself from my own history and trusting a vampire scientist to do it safely.

The irony is exquisite, which means Dravik must have savored it.

---

### **III. The Study**

By the time I reach the third floor, the castle’s bones have shifted from functional stone to academic wood. Shelves line the walls, sagging under the weight of books and scrolls. Tables bear glass apparatus: alembics, retorts, arrays of lenses that twist light into knives.

The Study smells of old paper and bitter herbs. Somewhere behind that, my nose picks up the bitter sharpness of alcohol and the faint sweetness of distillations. This was always as much a lab as a library.

I move through it with the reverence of a former devotee entering a ruined chapel. Every object seems to whisper half remembered lessons.

On one table I find diagrams of the mind rendered as mechanical schematics, gears for memories, pulleys for associations, guillotine blades poised above segments labeled “Regret,” “Shame,” “Attachment.” The precision is chilling. The handwriting is mine. Small bottles sit beside the diagrams, their labels clinical and cruel: **Selective Amnesia Draught**, **Empathy Severer**. All empty.

On another lies a notebook, bound in cracked leather. When I open it, the first page bears a sentence written in a tight, impatient script:

If he finds me again, he will wipe my mind clean.

The next pages are dense with calculations, circles within circles, notes on ritual interference patterns. Margins are full of frantic questions, How many loops already. How much can I smuggle past the erasure. What survives in muscle memory. In fear.

A folded scrap tumbles from between the pages, landing on the floor. It is wrapped around a tiny glass vial containing a single clear drop of liquid that clings stubbornly to the bottom, refusing to spread. The note around it reads, in my hand, **Last Resort: Memory Anchor, small radius, unpredictable side effects**. I tuck the **Memory Anchor Phial** into a separate inner pocket. It feels dangerous in a way the others do not.

I turn a page and see my own name.

It is a strange experience, reading it. The letters mean nothing to my conscious mind, yet some deeper layer in me recognizes the pattern the way a chord recognizes its own root note. I touch the ink with a fingertip and feel a brief flare of vertigo, as though standing at the edge of a very deep, very personal pit.

The notebook describes attempts to escape.

Paths through the castle. Weak points in the ritual. Experiments with keeping small objects on my person to see whether they persist across loops. Most of them end in the same scrawled notation, RESET. SUBJECT RETRIEVED. A few pages list items that sometimes carry over.

Cracked Red Tonic, often persists.  
 Kitchen Tonic, rarely persists.  
 Anchor Phial, unknown. Never tested.

At the end of the notebook, the handwriting deteriorates. Lines tilt. Ink blots. The last entry reads:

He praises my dedication to the work. He thinks this is a shared project. He does not understand that I am trying to undo it. Or perhaps he does, and he enjoys watching me fail.

The entry ends there. The rest of the page is deeply scored with lines that might once have been words and are now only grooves.

A sound interrupts my reading.

It is soft at first, like pages turning in a far room. Then it grows into something wetter, a dragging shuffle. The hairs rise on the back of my neck. I look up.

A figure lurks at the far end of the aisle, hunched over a stack of books. Thin hands turn pages with obsessive urgency. Strings of drool hang from their mouth, which mutters constantly.

“…loop… loop… loop…”

“Hello?” I call, because of course I do.

The figure stiffens. Slowly, painfully, it straightens and turns.

The Cursed Scholar’s face is a ruin of sleeplessness and ink bruise shadows. Quills bristle from their hair like broken feathers. Eyes bloodshot to the point of glowing focus on me with horrible clarity.

“You,” they hiss. “Again.”

Before I can respond, they surge toward me, hands weaving sigils in the air, mouth shaping words I recognize as my own theoretical lexicon for dismantling Dravik’s protections.

The fight that follows is less physical than the warden’s had been. Books leap from shelves, pages slashing like knives. Ink spills across the floor and rises in tendrils. I duck behind shelves, overturn tables, feel glass shatter against my shoulders. Phials burst around us, filling the air with bitter, dizzying fumes. My eyes sting, my lungs burn, and for a moment I taste the metallic tang of my own **Nightshade Tincture** as I smash a bottle into a tendril of ink and watch it stutter.

The Scholar moves with the frantic energy of someone who has spent centuries and sanity trying to solve a problem and watching the variable, me, reset each time.

“You drew it with him\!” they scream, hurling a bolt of thick black that nearly severs my ear. “You carved out your own history and left the rest of us in the wreckage\! You are not a victim; you are an accomplice\!”

“I know\!” I shout back, though I do not, not fully, not yet. But I feel the truth of it settling in my bones.

The battle ends with a miscalculated sigil. The Scholar’s own ink wrought weapon rebounds on them, enveloping their chest and head. They fall silently, body dissolving into letters that scatter across the floor like broken formulas. The last word that remains legible before the ink evaporates is simply, again.

In the quiet aftermath, a glow emerges from the center of the Study’s great circular reading room.

The third shard floats above a pedestal there, this one faceted like a crystal. When I touch it, the visions come not as a linear sequence but as a superposition of attempts, lines of my own research overlapping, diverging, collapsing into failure.

I see myself arguing with Dravik over parameters, insisting on safety margins he finds boring. I see myself erasing those margins under his cool persuasion, trading caution for elegance. I see the first successful extraction of a memory from a subject, the way the bottled shard pulses with a light that corresponds perfectly with their amnesia. Rows of phials, each labeled with a name and a lost memory, line the shelves like trophies.

Then I see my own name on the ledger labeled PRIMARY SUBJECT.

I see myself standing in the ritual circle, not bound but perfectly still, eyes shining with a fanatic’s focus. Dravik stands at the edge of the circle, hands folded, watching with the quiet interest of a man observing the final step in an experiment he has already predicted the outcome of.

“You understand,” he says, “that this will remove those parts of you that are inconsistent, that cling to the suffering you claim to despise.”

“Yes,” I reply.

“And you understand that repetition may be required. That we may have to refine and iterate.”

“Yes.”

His smile is small and approving. “Then begin, apprentice.”

I lower the knife to my own wrist.

The shard melts into me. My knees nearly buckle under the weight of the realization: I did this. I chose the loop. I built the cage and stepped into it, trusting the jailor.

The question that remains is: why.

---

### **IV. The Quarters**

The fourth floor feels like the inside of a memory I have not had yet.

Grand halls lined with banners lead into more intimate corridors. Doors here are carved with intricate patterns. The air smells faintly of incense. Through an archway I glimpse a chapel with cracked stained glass, its saints’ faces replaced with sigils. Brass basins hold stale holy water, crusted at the edges with a thin iridescent film that suggests someone, probably me, added more than a simple blessing to it once.

But I do not turn there first.

Some instinct guides my steps to a simpler door at the end of a side passage. The handle is worn smooth by frequent use. My hand fits it perfectly.

Inside is a room that is unmistakably mine.

A narrow bed. A desk cluttered with papers. A wardrobe containing neatly folded clothes, all in the same dull, practical colors. On the wall hangs a single framed page of formulae, the lines drawn with obsessive care.

A journal lies open on the desk.

The handwriting on the current page is tight and frantic, the ink blotted as though the writer’s hand, my hand, shook while writing.

He found the hidden shard.

The first line reads.

I had tucked it behind the stone by the stairwell, thinking he never came that way. I underestimated his curiosity. Or perhaps he followed me between loops. Perhaps he has been watching every time, recording the variations.

The next lines march down the page like condemned prisoners.

I cannot stop him while I am like this. Every run, I get a little further. Every run, he adjusts the parameters. I am a function converging on his desired result, not mine.

If I cannot break the loop, perhaps I can infect it.

The ink thickens there, as if the pen lingered.

Scatter my memories in places he cannot easily sterilize. Entangle them with the castle’s own sigils, with his own systems. Hide enough truth in the structure that some future iteration of me, not this one, not the next, but some, will reassemble it faster than he can erase it.

The final lines are written in nearly illegible haste.

If you are reading this, you are not the first. You are running along a groove worn by your own feet. But you are further than I ever got. That means the infection is working.

Remember this much: You chose the loop. He designed the parameters. Only both of you together can end it.

There is a place in the ritual where his control is weakest.

The journal ends there, the next page ripped out.

Beside the journal sits a small wooden case. My fingers open it without having to decide. Inside, nestled in dark velvet, are three carefully prepared phials and one small talisman.

One phial contains rich, opaque red liquid, thicker and more potent than the Cracked Red Tonic. The sigil marks it as **Major Vitality Draught**, enough to drag someone back from the edge.

The second glows a faint steady green, like moss lit from within, labeled **Regen Philter**, a slow, persistent healing that lingers for some time.

The third is nearly black, with shimmering flecks of violet that drift lazily, named only **Unknown Prototype** in my cramped shorthand. Beneath that, in smaller letters, I have written, do not waste this.

The talisman is a small disk of bone carved with the ouroboros, but the teeth have been altered, some blunted, some missing. The sigil is wrong in ways that itch at my eyes, a deliberate corruption. On the back, a single word: **Wardslip**. I loop it onto a cord around my neck and feel, for a moment, the castle’s attention slide off me like water off oiled leather.

I stand there in my old room, the ghost of my former self’s determination palpable in the air like the last echo of a shout. I want to hate them for agreeing to this, for making me their successor and their experiment, but I cannot quite separate them from myself. They are me. I am them. We are both.

Outside the room, something cries.

It is not a human sound. It is the sound of wind through a mouth that has done nothing but scream for centuries. I step back into the corridor.

The Memory Wraith waits at the intersection.

It is tall, but its height shifts, as though composed of many overlapping figures. Faces slide across its surface, my faces, I realize, from various points along whatever timeline I have managed to fragment. Eyes wide in hope, narrowed in calculation, hollowed in despair. The wraith moves toward me with the terrible inevitability of recursion.

“You thought you could escape yourself,” it says in a chorus of my own voices. “You thought you could burn away the parts you did not like and keep the rest.”

It lunges.

This fight is unlike the others. Where the warden struck with chains and the Scholar with ink, the Wraith strikes with moments.

As we clash, I am thrown back into scenes of previous loops, running down the cells corridor with a different limp; arguing with the kitchen woman, who in that version wept when she saw me; being dragged unconscious up the stairs by servants whose faces I now recognize from the hall below. Each blow knocks a new shard of memory into place.

My lungs burn, my muscles scream, and I uncork the **Regen Philter** with my teeth, swallowing a mouthful mid struggle. It tastes like bitter roots and old rain, and a slow warmth starts to spread through my limbs, stitching small tears as fast as the Wraith can make them.

I see a version of myself who refused the experiment and was brought here in chains.

I see one who embraced it completely, begging Dravik to increase the frequency of resets.

I see one who tried to kill him in the laboratory and failed, waking up in the cell again with a fresh mask of bandages.

The Wraith is all of these and more.

“You are not just a victim,” it hisses, its hand closing around my throat. “You are a convergence of choices, yours and his. The loop is not a mistake. It is the limit of the function you defined together.”

Something in me snaps.

I drive my fist, not with a weapon, but with bare knuckles, into the Wraith’s chest. It feels like punching water that remembers being stone. The Wraith staggers. The room flickers between the current corridor and a dozen previous configurations.

“You are right,” I gasp. “But every function has conditions under which it fails.”

I seize one of the flickering images, a moment in which a past me had carved a counter sigil into this very floor, and yank it fully into the present.

Lines appear on the stone beneath our feet, blazing with sudden light, not Dravik’s careful, tooth edged circles, but something messier, designed in haste by an earlier me who had been desperate enough to improvise. The **Wardslip** at my throat grows hot, resonating with the damaged sigil.

The Wraith screams as the light enfolds it. Its many faces twist, merging, dissolving. For a second I look into my own eyes, tired, furious, determined, and then the creature is gone, leaving only a lingering echo and the smell of ozone.

In the silence that follows, a final shard rises from the disrupted stone.

This vision is brief and terrible.

I see the ritual hall at the top of the castle. I see Dravik standing beside the apparatus I helped him build, a forest of glass and metal, mirrors and chains that channel light into a central throne shaped construct. I see myself strapped to that throne, eyes wide with ecstasy or terror or both.

Dravik leans down.

“Iteration complete,” he says in the vision. “Results promising. We will reset and push parameters further.”

My former self laughs hoarsely. “One day,” they say, “an iteration will break you instead.”

Dravik’s smile is softly condescending. “In that case,” he replies, “I look forward to the data.”

The shard sinks into my chest like a stone into water. When the ripple passes, I know two things with absolute clarity:

First, that I have climbed this far before and never made it further.

Second, that if I can reach the ritual hall this time, I will remember enough to hurt him.

---

### **V. The Tower**

The staircase to the fifth floor is a spiral narrow enough to be claustrophobic. Wind threads down it from above, carrying the faint chill of dawn air. My legs ache. My mind feels like a library whose shelves have been knocked over, books spilling out faster than I can read them. Glass clinks softly whenever I move, my belt loaded with the accumulated pharmacopeia of my former self.

At the top, a door awaits.

It is made of some dark metal that swallows light. The sigil at its center is familiar, the teeth ouroboros, more intricate now, with additions that form a complex diagram of recurrence. Little circles along its edge match the size of phial mouths. I realize, abruptly, that part of the lock was always keyed to my own inventory.

I lay my marked wrist against it.

Heat rushes through the metal, recognizing its own pattern. The door unlocks with a low, satisfying thrum and swings inward.

The ritual hall is a cathedral of mad science.

Mirrors tower in arches overhead, their surfaces etched with sigils that catch and split the candlelight into a thousand looping beams. Chains descend from the ceiling, not to bind bodies but to suspend glass cylinders filled with swirling, luminous fragments, memory shards, hundreds of them, each pulsing in its own rhythm. Tables at the edges of the hall hold neatly organized rows of potions and reagents, labeled with my precise hand. I realize with a twist of disgust that this entire place is both laboratory and armory, and I built half of it.

At the center of it all sits the throne.

It is less a chair than a convergence point: metal and bone and glass meeting in a design that channels all those mirrored beams down into a single locus, the heart of whoever sits there.

Tonight, that someone is not me.

Lord Dravik stands beside the throne, one hand resting lightly on its arm as if on the shoulder of a beloved pet. He wears the same high collared coat from my visions, though time has added no lines to his face. Vampirism and obsessive self maintenance will do that. His eyes are bright, amused, and utterly unsurprised to see me.

“Apprentice,” he says, and in his mouth the word is both compliment and collar. “Right on schedule.”

I step fully into the hall, letting the door swing shut behind me. “How many times have we had this conversation?” I ask.

He considers. “That depends on how you count. Strictly speaking, this is the sixty third instance in which you have reached the tower with enough cognitive integrity to speak in complete sentences.” He tilts his head. “Which means the infection you seeded in the system is working very nicely.”

My breath catches. “You knew.”

“Of course I knew.” His smile is gentle. “You are intelligent, but you are not opaque to me. Every adjustment you tried to make to the loop, I observed. Every shard you hid, I watched you place. It was charming.” He steps away from the throne, strolling around me in a slow circle. As he passes one of the potion tables, he trails a finger along a row of phials, some of which I recognize from my belt. “I allowed it.”

“Allowed…”

He gestures at the hall. “What is experiment without variation. You think yourself my rebel creation, but you are my collaborator still. This stage of the project concerns resilience, how the self reasserts itself under repetitive erasure. Your attempts to outmaneuver me are not errors in the method; they are the method.”

Anger flares hot in my chest. “You used me to test my own resistance to you.”

“Exactly.” He looks pleased that I have kept up.

The mirrored beams glint off his eyes, making them seem almost kind. “But take heart,” he continues. “This is the furthest you have come with this degree of recollection. The function is converging.”

“On what?”

“On acceptance, of course.” His tone is patient, as if explaining calculus to a stubborn child. “Every time you climb, you carry a few more fragments of memory, a few more self observations. You grow more aware of the loop, more aware of your complicity in its creation. Eventually, you will come to understand that there is nothing to escape.” He spreads his hands. “We are the loop, you and I. We are its authors and its executors.”

I look up at the swirling cylinders of stolen memory. Each one holds a version of me that never got this far, never remembered this much. The fear that has been rising in me throughout the castle peaks, not as a shriek but as a quiet, focused line. Glass clinks at my waist. My fingers brush the **Memory Anchor Phial**.

“You think I will accept this,” I say. “You think I will sit in that chair willingly again.”

“Not think,” he replies. “Know. You did once. You will again. Iteration is proof.”

He moves closer, his presence cool and steady, the smell of old books and colder things lingering around him. “Join me, apprentice. No more struggling against the method you designed. Help me perfect it. Imagine a world in which pain can be excised as cleanly as a tumor, memories reshaped to fit better lives. You wanted that before you forgot. You can want it again.”

His eyes search mine, and for a terrifying moment I feel the pull of him, the allure of order, of a world where everything painful about myself could be neatly labeled and severed. He speaks the language my past self loved, refinement, convergence, perfection.

He does not lie. That might be the worst of it. He simply omits the costs.

“What happens,” I ask quietly, “if I say no?”

He lifts one shoulder. “Then we reset. We have done it many times. There is data to be gained from your resistance as well. I simply think you will find acceptance less fatiguing.”

The tower seems very still.

The teeth on my wrist burn. All the shards I have collected hum within me, their memories braiding into a single, painful thread. I see the contract I signed. The subjects I agreed to use. The servants who have watched me loop again and again. The Scholar’s accusation. The Wraith’s chorus of selves. The potions I brewed to keep people alive just long enough to keep suffering useful.

He is right about one thing: I am not innocent.

But neither is he the sole author.

I step toward the throne.

For a heartbeat, hope flares in his eyes, swiftly masked. He gestures, and the apparatus responds, chains gently shifting aside to admit me. I sit. Cold metal cradles my spine. Glass arcs close around my head.

“You see?” he murmurs, leaning in. “Even now, you return to the design. You understand that this is where you belong.”

The apparatus whirs to life.

Light pours down from the mirrors above, channelled through sigil etched glass. Beams converge toward the mark on my wrist, then spread through me like roots seeking purchase in soil. I feel them searching for the lines of self I once mapped for him, the threads of memory, the nodes of identity.

For the first time in all the loops, I do not fight the mapping.

I ride it.

Every shard I have absorbed flares, not as isolated memories, but as part of a network. The sigils carved into the castle, into the apparatus, into my own skin, they are all related expressions of one underlying function, written by two hands. His and mine.

He designed the outer constraints.

I designed the inner pathways.

He leans close, ready to begin the erasure phrase. “Iteration sixty three…”

I interrupt him.

“That is the problem with functions, Lord Dravik,” I say, my voice echoing strangely as light threads through my nerves. “They never quite behave once you run them outside the bounds you assumed.”

He frowns, just slightly.

With my free hand, I uncork the **Memory Anchor Phial** and swallow the single clear drop. It burns like liquid ice, lodging in my chest, tying my current self to every version of me that ever climbed these stairs. The apparatus tries to smooth me out and instead finds knots it cannot untangle.

I twist.

Not my body. I suspect he would break me in an instant. I twist the structure of the ritual itself. My earlier self, the one who decided to infect the system, left back doors in the sigils, hooks only I can catch now that I remember enough. I seize them and pull.

The light streaming through the apparatus bends.

Instead of following the paths he laid out, smooth arcs toward tidy erasure, they kink into new shapes, looping back through the mirrors, feeding into shards that were never meant to be active simultaneously. The phials on the surrounding tables rattle, their contents glowing in sympathy, all that stored potential finally finding something to do besides prolong pain.

The hall shudders.

“What are you doing?” he snaps, the first crack of real alarm in his voice.

“Iterating,” I say.

Every shard in the room ignites. Memories spill out of their glass prisons, mine, others’, a whole crowd of discarded lives. The air is suddenly full of voices, the kitchen woman’s resigned mutter, the Scholar’s furious scream, the Warden’s rasp, the countless whimpers and laughs and gasps of those we experimented on. Bottled emotions, once neatly categorized in phials, surge free, wrapping around Dravik like chains.

All of them converge on him.

He staggers, bombarded by the flood of experience. His hands claw at the air as if to push the memories back into their bottles, but the ritual no longer obeys him.

“You cannot…” he begins.

I do not know exactly what happens to a consciousness like his when overloaded, but I see enough to know it is not the clean death revenge stories promise. It is more like watching a library catch fire from the inside, book by book, each screaming as it burns. The concoctions on the tables burst one by one, potions meant to numb and erase mixing into a chaotic brew of everything he ever tried to control.

The mirrors crack. The chains snap. The apparatus around me disintegrates into shards of glass and metal that fall like rain. The floor bucks; the towers above groan.

The loop is breaking.

The question, as the world shatters around us, is whether I am breaking with it or through it.

Light engulfs me.

### **VI. The Ending That Is Not the End**

I wake to the sound of water.

The drip is slower this time.

My face is on stone. My back is cold. A lantern swings beyond bars. Chains hang on the wall; sigils mark the stone in black. The sigil on my wrist, the teeth ouroboros, stings faintly.

For a moment, icy dread claws up my spine. Did it fail. Was all of that only another iteration logged and reset.

Then I notice the silence.

There is no bell tolling above. No echo of servants moving. No distant hum of ritual machinery vibrating through the walls. The castle feels empty, like a shell evacuated by whatever creature once lived inside.

I stand, slower than before.

The cell door hangs open as usual. My belt still carries a few familiar weights, though many phials are cracked and empty now, their contents spent in the breaking. The **Wardslip** at my throat is dull bone again, its sigil inert. The **Memory Anchor** is gone, which feels right. Anchors are meant to be left behind.

When I step into the corridor, the sigils on the walls are dead lines, their power gone. The air smells only of dust. The cells I pass contain nothing but cobwebs.

At the foot of the stairs, a plaque I do not remember seeing before has been bolted into the wall. Its surface is blank except for a single hand carved sentence:

There is no clean slate. Only the stories you choose to carry forward.

The handwriting is mine.

I laugh then, despite everything. Despite the ache in my bones, the residue of a hundred deaths, the knowledge that I will never fully recover what I cut away. I laugh because it is not the triumphant cackle of a villain, nor the brittle giggle of a broken mind, but something steadier.

Something that might one day become forgiveness, for myself, if not for Dravik.

Above, where the tower once rose, I can see a strip of dawn through a fracture in the ceiling. Light spills down, soft and unremarkable, utterly free of sigils.

I walk toward it.

Every step takes me past remnants of what we built together, a broken circle here, a charred mirror there, shattered glass phials crunching under my boots. None of them hum with power anymore. They are just objects, like bones after the animal is gone. My inventory, once a careful curation of survival, is now mostly junk and empty glass. That feels correct. Power should not be neat or bottled anymore.

At the main gate, how did I never reach this far before, I push open doors that used to be barred by mechanisms I designed. They groan, but they move. Beyond them lies not another loop, not another corridor, but the world.

Trees. Mist. A road.

I step out.

The sigil on my wrist throbs once, then quiets. The teeth remain, a scar that will never fully fade, but they no longer move of their own accord. No potions tick at the edge of my awareness, no timers, no carefully balanced buffs. Just breath, and sky, and the raw, unmeasured ache of being alive.

Somewhere, in some forgotten ledger, Dravik’s experiment ends mid sentence.

Mine, however, continues.

I do not know my full name yet, but I know this much: I am the apprentice of my own choices now, and that is more terrifying, and more hopeful, than any loop he could design.

I walk into the uncertain morning, the castle collapsing behind me like a story finally allowed to end.
