            <h1>CASTLE NOCTURNE</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A Tale of Blood and Memory</p>
        </header>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            Deep within the shadow-cursed lands, Castle Nocturne stands as a monument to dark ambition.
            For centuries, Lord Dravik has ruled from its obsidian towers, conducting forbidden experiments
            in the pursuit of immortality.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            Those who enter the castle's gates speak of time itself bending within its walls. Many have ventured into its
            depths seeking power, knowledge, or revenge.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            Beware, if the records and rumors are true, none have returned.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            You awaken on cold stone, deep in the castle's dungeons. A sigil burns upon your wrist—an
            ouroboros of teeth, marking you as something more than prisoner. Your memories are fragments,
            your past a mystery.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            But one truth remains clear: to escape Castle Nocturne, you must face the horrors within...
            and perhaps discover who you truly are.
