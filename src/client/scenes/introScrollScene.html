            <h1>CASTLE NOCTURNE</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">A Tale of Blood and Memory</p>
        </header>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            Deep within the shadow-cursed lands, Castle Nocturne stands as a monument to dark ambition.
            For centuries, Lord Dravik has ruled from its obsidian towers, conducting forbidden experiments
            in the pursuit of immortality.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            Those who enter the castle's gates speak of time itself bending within its walls—of loops
            that repeat, of memories that fade and return like the tide. Many have ventured into its
            depths seeking power, knowledge, or revenge.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            None have returned.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            You awaken on cold stone, deep in the castle's dungeons. A sigil burns upon your wrist—an
            ouroboros of teeth, marking you as something more than prisoner. Your memories are fragments,
            your past a mystery.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-content">
            But one truth remains clear: to escape Castle Nocturne, you must face the horrors within...
            and perhaps discover who you truly are.
